Assignment: Handling Missing Data in ETL

Objective

	This assignment explains why missing data occurs in ETL pipelines, how different handling techniques impact analytics, 
	and how to choose the right method instead of blindly deleting data.

SECTION A – THEORETICAL QUESTIONS

Q1. What are the most common reasons for missing data in ETL pipelines?

>	Human error during data entry.

>	System integration issues.

>	Incomplete records from source systems.

>	Sensor or API failures.

>	Data corruption or migration errors.

Q2. Why is blindly deleting rows with missing values considered a bad practice in ETL? 

>	Because it reduces dataset size, may remove valuable information, and can introduce bias into analysis.

Q3. Explain the difference between Listwise deletion and Column deletion. Mention one scenario where each is appropriate.

>	Listwise deletion: Removes entire rows with missing values. Appropriate when only a few rows are incomplete.

>	Column deletion: Removes entire columns with too many missing values. Appropriate when a column is mostly empty and not useful.

Q4. Why is median imputation preferred over mean imputation for skewed data such as income?

>	Median is less affected by extreme values (outliers), making it more reliable for skewed distributions like income.


Q5. What is forward fill and in what type of dataset is it most useful?  

>	Forward fill replaces missing values with the last known value. It is most useful in time-series datasets where values change gradually over time.

Q6. Why should flagging missing values be done before imputation in an ETL workflow?  

>	Flagging helps track which values were originally missing, allowing analysts to study patterns of missingness and avoid misleading conclusions.

Q7. Consider a scenario where income is missing for many customers. How can this missingness itself provide business insights?  

>	It may indicate reluctance to disclose income, highlight specific customer segments, or reveal gaps in data collection processes.




SECTION B – PRACTICAL QUESTIONS


Dataset Provided:  

	Customer_ID, Name, City, Monthly_Sales, Income, Region (with some missing values).

Q8. Listwise Deletion – Remove all rows where Region is missing.

>	Affected row: Customer_ID 105 (Region = NaN).

>	Dataset after deletion: All rows except 105 remain.

>	Records lost: 1.


Q9. Imputation – Handle missing values in Monthly_Sales using Forward Fill.

>	Before: Customer_ID 102, 104, 106 had Monthly_Sales = NaN.

After Forward Fill:

	102 → 12000 (from 101)

	104 → 15000 (from 103)

	106 → 18000 (from 105)

	Forward fill is suitable because Monthly_Sales is sequential and can reasonably carry forward previous values.


Q10. Flagging Missing Data – Create a flag column for missing Income.

>	New column: Income_Missing_Flag (0 = present, 1 = missing).

>	Customers with missing income: 102, 104, 107.

>	Count of missing income = 3.
